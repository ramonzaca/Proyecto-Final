	<Description>
		Binary 3-Multiplexer task with binary inputs/outputs.
		Evaluation consists of testing a network against each of the 8 (=2^3) possible input combinations. An output less than 0.5 is considered a binary 0 answer, and >=0.5 a binary 1. However, fitness is scored based on how close a given network's response is to each correct answer, therefore the maximum fitness is 8 if exact answers are given, and the minimum possible fitness while still being correct overall is approx. 4.

		To distinguish between correct low scorers and incorrect low scorers an additional value of 100 is added to the score of networks that give a correct response to each of the 8 test cases. Max fitness is therefore 108.
